# Lab Material for *Intro to AI & ML* Course 

This repository provides lab materials for the [Introduction to AI & ML online course](http://college.synnovateinc.com/courses/ai-ml/), 
supported by [Synnovate Inc](http://synnovateinc.com/). 

As the first Machine Learning project, you are going to see how the word embedding networks using a simple code snippet, 
running under Jupyter notebook, forked from [here](https://github.com/buomsoo-kim/Word-embedding-with-Python).   

## Prerequisites

Install [python](www.python.org).
Make sure that you have successfully installed python (version 3.6 or above) in your system.
To do so, in the command prompt, type the `python --version` command. Go ahead if the version is 3.6 or above.
 
To implement the word-embedding network with *gensim* under the *Jupyter Notebook*, 
the following packages should be installed on your system:

* jupyter
* gensim
* numpy
* nltk

To install the required packages in one shot, go ahead and download the `requirments.txt` 
file from the repository, and run the following command in the path containing the txt file:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Running under the Jupyter Notebook

The plain `jupyter notebook` command runs the web application that allows you to create 
and share documents that contain live code. 

To run the *word2vec* implementation provided in this repository, run the following command in 
the command line in the path containing the *word2vec.ipynb* file.

```
jupyter notebook word2vec.ipynb
```
